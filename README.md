# AI Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯  

## Introduction  
This is an AI-powered number guessing game where the computer tries to guess a secret number chosen by the user. It uses a smart technique called Binary Search to guess the number in the shortest time possible.  

---

## How It Works?  
1. The user selects a secret number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 100).  
2. The AI starts by guessing the middle number of the range.  
3. The user provides feedback:  
   - Too high â†’ The AI eliminates higher numbers.  
   - Too low â†’ The AI eliminates lower numbers.  
   - Correct! â†’ The AI wins! ðŸŽ‰  
4. The AI repeats this process until it finds the correct number.

## Why This Approach? 
âœ… Efficient â€“ Finds the number in very few attempts  
âœ… Logical â€“ Uses a divide-and-conquer strategy  
âœ… Always Correct â€“ The AI will always find the number
